// The advantage, is that we can handle all of the routes, and use our own logic here to determine what to do.

// now ... we can look at the route, and match it withe known patterns that we anticipate, based upon our criteria, such as:
// specific slugs
// the number of slugs
// ??? a combination of these things.
// we could also have special things for things like the book club.
