// AllRoutes. One single Route that catches everything. The big drawback, is that route based code-splitting is affected: all code required for any route in this catch-all needs to be bundled
// The advantage, is that we can handle all of the routes, and use our own logic here to determine what to do.

// now ... we can look at the route, and match it withe known patterns that we anticipate, based upon our criteria, such as:
// specific slugs
// the number of slugs
// ??? a combination of these things.
// we could also have special things for things like the book club.

// so what would an experiment to determine the feasibility of using this for our stack look like?
// we need to make a call to the CAA, and then either send a 200 response, or a 301 or a 404, depending upon what has been returned from the API

// one tricky problem that I want us to solve the heights of images ... and cululative layout shiift: https://web.dev/cls/
// but what to do about the images that are appeearing in the content of wp posts?
// we can do something about the featured images, specifying heights and so on.
// but what about the images within the content? That is much trickier.
// maybe there iis a thing that could be done on wp-side? to make the image beforee load complete occupy the space it will occupy after load complete
// maybe we can specify the exact height in the <img /> tag of the post_content?

// another thing we could do to mitigate CLS is measuring the heights of tings in the stack, and remembering them ( remeber to reset on resize),
// and making the containers maintain that previously calculated height.
